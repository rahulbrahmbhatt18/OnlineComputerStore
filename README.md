# OnlineComputerStore
Web application with primary focus on the database.

Online Computer Store is an online application program interface that is easy to use so that the company does not have to spend time unnecessarily to train their employees. The program interface is easy for the customers. In particular this application focuses on the following three  applications: Customer  registration  and  management, Online sales, and Collection of statistics. The last application is crucial in decision making by the analysts, managers and knowledge workers of the company. For instance, it will allow the introduction of new products in certain categories or the discontinuation of certain products, or the suggestion of new offers to increase the profit of the company. 

This project primarily focuses on the database management system. It has been created as a part of my project work for CS 631: Data Management System Design at New Jersey Institute of Technology. It has been designed using PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and MySQL.
